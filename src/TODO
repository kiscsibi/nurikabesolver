* check the whole loadlevel thing if everything works correctly
  and if all exceptions are caught by the gui
  
* program generator
* program solver

* heuristicfix for reachables -> no grays next to other walls
* heuristicfix if Wall.getNBGray > 1 AND for all except one (g_1.size + ... + g_n-1.size) < limit - size wall => gn = white  
* heuristic unnumbered whites that only can come from one wall belong to that wall. Consequence is that direction get partly defined.
